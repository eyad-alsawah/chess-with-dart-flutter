   A FEN string defines a particular position using only the ASCII character set.

   A FEN string contains six fields separated by a space. The fields are:

   1) Piece placement (from white's perspective). Each rank is described, starting
      with rank 8 and ending with rank 1. Within each rank, the contents of each
      square are described from file A through file H. Following the Standard
      Algebraic Notation (SAN), each piece is identified by a single letter taken
      from the standard English names. White pieces are designated using upper-case
      letters ("PNBRQK") whilst Black uses lowercase ("pnbrqk"). Blank squares are
      noted using digits 1 through 8 (the number of blank squares), and "/"
      separates ranks.

   2) Active color. "w" means white moves next, "b" means black.

   3) Castling availability. If neither side can castle, this is "-". Otherwise,
      this has one or more letters: "K" (White can castle kingside), "Q" (White
      can castle queenside), "k" (Black can castle kingside), and/or "q" (Black
      can castle queenside).

   4) En passant target square (in algebraic notation). If there's no en passant
      target square, this is "-". If a pawn has just made a 2-square move, this
      is the position "behind" the pawn. Following X-FEN standard, this is recorded
      only if there is a pawn in position to make an en passant capture, and if
      there really is a pawn that might have advanced two squares.

   5) Halfmove clock. This is the number of halfmoves since the last pawn advance
      or capture. This is used to determine if a draw can be claimed under the
      fifty-move rule.

   6) Fullmove number. The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is
      incremented after Black's move.
